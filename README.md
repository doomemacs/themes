# doom-themes

A theme megapack for GNU Emacs, inspired by community favorites. Special
attention is given for [Doom Emacs](https://doomemacs.org) and [solaire-mode]
support, but will work fine anywhere else.

## Install

### Doom Emacs

The built-in `:ui doom` module installs and configures `doom-themes` for you,
and loads `doom-one` by default. To change the theme, change `doom-theme`:

``` emacs-lisp
;; in ~/.doom.d/config.el
(setq doom-theme 'doom-city-lights)
```

### Manually + `use-package`

`doom-themes` is available on MELPA. Here is an example configuration with some
common defaults laid out:

```emacs-lisp
(use-package doom-themes
  :ensure t
  :config
  ;; Global settings (defaults)
  (setq doom-themes-enable-bold t    ; if nil, bold is universally disabled
        doom-themes-enable-italic t) ; if nil, italics is universally disabled
  (load-theme 'doom-one t)

  ;; Enable flashing mode-line on errors
  (doom-themes-visual-bell-config)
  ;; Enable custom neotree theme (all-the-icons must be installed!)
  (doom-themes-neotree-config)
  ;; or for treemacs users
  (setq doom-themes-treemacs-theme "doom-atom") ; use "doom-colors" for less minimal icon theme
  (doom-themes-treemacs-config)
  ;; Corrects (and improves) org-mode's native fontification.
  (doom-themes-org-config))
```

### Planned themes

| Name                                 | Description                                              |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `doom-mono-dark` / `doom-mono-light` | a minimalistic, monochromatic theme                      |
| `doom-tron`                          | based on Tron Legacy from [daylerees' themes][daylerees] |


## Extensions
[Check out the wiki for details on customizing our neotree/treemacs/etc
extensions][wiki].

- `(doom-themes-visual-bell-config)`: flash the mode-line when the Emacs bell
  rings (i.e. an error occurs). May not be compatible with all mode line
  plugins.
- `(doom-themes-neotree-config)`: a [neotree] theme that takes after [Atom]'s
  file drawer; a more minimalistic icon theme plus variable pitch file/directory
  labels, as seen [in the doom-one screenshot](/../screenshots/doom-one.png).

  (This requires `all-the-icons`' fonts to be installed: `M-x
  all-the-icons-install-fonts`)
- `(doom-themes-treemacs-config)`: two [treemacs] icon themes, one that takes after
  [Atom]'s, and a second more colorful implementation.
- `(doom-themes-org-config)`: corrects and improves some of org-mode's native
  fontification issues.
  -  Re-set `org-todo` & `org-headline-done` faces to make them respect
     underlying faces (i.e. don't override the :height or :background of
     underlying faces).
  -  Make statistic cookies respect underlying faces.
  -  Fontify item bullets (make them stand out)
  -  Fontify item checkboxes (and when they're marked done), like TODOs that
     are marked done.
  -  Fontify dividers/separators (5+ dashes)
  -  Fontify #hashtags and @at-tags, for personal convenience; see
     `doom-org-special-tags` to disable this.
     
## Complimentary plugins
The following plugins compliment our themes:

- To get dimmed sidebars and brighter source buffers (like in the
  [screenshots]), see [solaire-mode].
- [AnthonyDiGirolamo] added doom-one ([screenshot][airline-doom-one]) and
  doom-molokai ([screenshot][airline-doom-molokai]) skins to
  [airline-themes][airline-themes].
- The modeline in the screenshots is
  [doom-modeline](https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline).
     
## FAQ
+ **I don't like X in theme Y, can I change it?**
  _Yes._ Several themes have variable customization options. Use `C-h v ^doom-`
  or `M-x customize-group RET doom-themes` to explore them.
  
  Alternatively, use `custom-set-faces` (Doom users should use
  `custom-set-faces!` instead) to customize any face. e.g.
  
  ```elisp
  ;; Must be used *after* the theme is loaded
  (custom-set-faces
    `(mode-line ((t (:background ,(doom-color 'dark-violet)))))
    `(font-lock-comment-face ((t (:foreground ,(doom-color 'base6))))))
  ```
  
+ **These themes don't look good in the terminal. Why?**
  Many of our themes don't degrade well into 256 colors, so expect a different
  experience in terminal Emacs vs GUI Emacs. In order to enjoy these themes as
  they're intended, either use the GUI or set up your shell to display 24bit
  color, if it is capable of it.
  
  There are multiple guides for setting up 24bit color in your terminal, [for
  example](http://www.skybert.net/emacs/colourful-tty-emacs).
