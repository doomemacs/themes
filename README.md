# Doom Emacs' Theme Pack

A theme megapack for GNU Emacs, inspired by community favorites. Special
attention is given for [Doom Emacs](https://doomemacs.org) and [solaire-mode]
support, but will work fine anywhere else. 

[See the screenshots.][screenshots]

## Install

### Doom Emacs

The built-in `:ui doom` module installs and configures `doom-themes` for you,
and loads `doom-one` by default. To change the theme, change `doom-theme`:

``` emacs-lisp
;; in ~/.doom.d/config.el
(setq doom-theme 'doom-city-lights)
```

### Manually + `use-package`

`doom-themes` is available on MELPA. Here is an example configuration with some
common defaults laid out:

```emacs-lisp
(use-package doom-themes
  :ensure t
  :config
  ;; Global settings (defaults)
  (setq doom-themes-enable-bold t    ; if nil, bold is universally disabled
        doom-themes-enable-italic t) ; if nil, italics is universally disabled
  (load-theme 'doom-one t)

  ;; Enable flashing mode-line on errors
  (doom-themes-visual-bell-config)
  ;; Enable custom neotree theme (all-the-icons must be installed!)
  (doom-themes-neotree-config)
  ;; or for treemacs users
  (setq doom-themes-treemacs-theme "doom-atom") ; use "doom-colors" for less minimal icon theme
  (doom-themes-treemacs-config)
  ;; Corrects (and improves) org-mode's native fontification.
  (doom-themes-org-config))
```


## Theme list

This megapack's first and flagship theme is `doom-one` (inspired by Atom One
Dark), but also includes 67 themes submitted to us by the Emacs community. We
welcome PRs to help us maintain and address inconsistencies in them.

## Extensions
[Check out the wiki for details on customizing our neotree/treemacs/etc
extensions][wiki].

- `(doom-themes-visual-bell-config)`: flash the mode-line when the Emacs bell
  rings (i.e. an error occurs). May not be compatible with all mode line
  plugins.
- `(doom-themes-neotree-config)`: a [neotree] theme that takes after [Atom]'s
  file drawer; a more minimalistic icon theme plus variable pitch file/directory
  labels, as seen [in the doom-one screenshot](/../screenshots/doom-one.png).

  (This requires `all-the-icons`' fonts to be installed: `M-x
  all-the-icons-install-fonts`)
- `(doom-themes-treemacs-config)`: two [treemacs] icon themes, one that takes after
  [Atom]'s, and a second more colorful implementation.
- `(doom-themes-org-config)`: corrects and improves some of org-mode's native
  fontification issues.
  -  Re-set `org-todo` & `org-headline-done` faces to make them respect
     underlying faces (i.e. don't override the :height or :background of
     underlying faces).
  -  Make statistic cookies respect underlying faces.
  -  Fontify item bullets (make them stand out)
  -  Fontify item checkboxes (and when they're marked done), like TODOs that
     are marked done.
  -  Fontify dividers/separators (5+ dashes)
  -  Fontify #hashtags and @at-tags, for personal convenience; see
     `doom-org-special-tags` to disable this.
     
## Complementary plugins
The following plugins complement our themes:

- To get dimmed sidebars and brighter source buffers (like in the
  [screenshots]), see [solaire-mode].
- [AnthonyDiGirolamo] added doom-one ([screenshot][airline-doom-one]) and
  doom-molokai ([screenshot][airline-doom-molokai]) skins to
  [airline-themes][airline-themes].
- The modeline in the screenshots is
  [doom-modeline](https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline).
     
## Customization
There are three ways to customize themes in this package:

1. Explore the available variables provided by our themes, starting with the
   ones provided for all packages:
   + `doom-themes-enable-bold` (default: `t`): if `nil`, disables bolding as
     much as possible (only affects faces that our theme supports; it won't
     catch them all).
   + `doom-themes-enable-italic` (default: `t`): if `nil`, disables
     italicization as much as possible (only affects faces that our theme
     supports; it won't catch them all).
   + `doom-themes-padded-modeline` (default: `nil`): if `t`, pad the mode-line
     in 4px on each side. Can also be set to an integer to specify the exact
     padding.  or `M-x customize-group RET doom-themes` to explore them.
  
2. Use the `custom-set-faces` macro (Doom users should use `custom-set-faces!`
   instead) to customize any face. e.g.
  
   ```elisp
   ;; Must be used *after* the theme is loaded
   (custom-set-faces
     `(mode-line ((t (:background ,(doom-color 'dark-violet)))))
     `(font-lock-comment-face ((t (:foreground ,(doom-color 'base6))))))
   ```
  
3. Copy your favorite theme into your `custom-theme-directory` (normally
   `~/.emacs.d/`, or `~/.doom.d/themes` for Doom users), and tweak it there.
